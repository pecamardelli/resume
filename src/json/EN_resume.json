    "description": "Former SysAdmin turned into a full stack developer. Yes! That's me. I worked for several years in IT infrastructure and now my passion is development. I enjoy creating software and the most exciting part is that there are challenges everywhere for us! My skills are focused on web apps development, such as Progressive Web Apps, Single Page Applications and so on. Some of my preferred tools are Nodejs, Reactjs, Express for RESTful APIs, GraphQL with Apollo, MySQL and MongoDB as relational and non-relational databases, respectively",

    "bio": "I've been always said that I learn fast. In this profession you need to learn fast, I respond. I feel passion for computer science and everything that uses a microchip. I've started programming before I knew how to install an operating system when I was at college. Later on, I began to learn more and more while working at the IT department of various companies, leading several successful projects, most of them related to IT infrastructure and some others related to software development. Today, my skills are focused on developing web apps, using JavaScript with Nodejs, Reactjs, RESTful APIs, GraphQL with Apollo-server & client and relational and non-relational databases (MySQL and MongoDB respectively). I always give the best of me because I know that success can only be achieved by dedicating a huge amount of effort and will. I also love video games; I grew up with them and now I invest part of my time on making my own games like I dreamed when I was a young kid.",
